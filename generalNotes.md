<h1>Java</h1>
<h2>JVM(Java Virtual Machine)</h2>
There are 3 types of high-level programming languages:\n
- <strong>Compiled:</strong> The code is compiled (translated) into a machine code that runs on a specific platform (Microsoft/Mac/...)\n
- <strong>Interpreted:</strong> Translate the code into machine code whenever you run the program, the translation to machine code won't be saved in any form. If you want to rerun the code you have to retranslate the whole code again. That is what makes interpreted programming languages slower than compiled ones.
